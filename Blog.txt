In Tableau, "Actions" are interactive features that allow users to dynamically filter, highlight, or navigate between different views within a dashboard by clicking on specific marks on a chart, essentially creating a more engaging and interactive experience for data analysis.actions in the tableau are used to add an interactive element to these dashboards and let the user build customized dashboards.

 to access actions, navigate to "Dashboard" > "Actions" and then choose the type of action you want to create, such as "Filter Action", "Highlight Action", or "URL Action" depending on your desired functionality
In Tableau, "actions" are crucial because they allow users to interact dynamically with visualizations on a dashboard, enabling them to explore data more deeply by filtering, highlighting, or navigating between different views based on their selections, ultimately creating a more engaging and insightful user experience.

Types of actions

Go to URL. Create hyperlinks to external resources, such as a web page or file.

Filter. Use the data from one view to filter data in another.
Highlight. Call attention to marks of interest by dimming all others.
Go to Sheet. Simplify navigation to other worksheets, dashboards, or stories in the same workbook.
Change Parameter. Let users change parameter values by directly interacting with marks on a viz.
Change Set Values. Let users change the values in a set by directly interacting with marks on a viz.



Now lets go through one by one 

Go to URL :

A URL action is a hyperlink that points to a web page, file, or other web-based resource outside of Tableau.When you set up a URL Action, you can specify an external URL to be opened when a user clicks on a specific part of the visualization, such as a mark, field, or a dashboard element.A URL action builds on this and allows your end users to control what is shown on the web page by passing a value into the URL link when the user interacts with a chart. 

How to Create a URL Action in Tableau:

1.Go to the "Worksheet" or "Dashboard": Open the worksheet or dashboard where you want to create the action.
2.Navigate to the "Worksheet" Menu: Select Worksheet > Actionsâ€¦.
3.Add a New Action: Click on Add Action and then choose Go To URL.
